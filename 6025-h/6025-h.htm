ENGLISHMAN</h2>
<p class="poetry">Born in the flesh, and bred in the bone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of us harbour still<br />
A New World pride: and we flaunt or hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spirit of Bunker Hill.<br />
We claim our place, as a separate race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a self-created clan;<br />
Till there comes a day when we like to say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;We are kin of the Englishman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">For under the front that seems so cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice that is wont to storm,<br />
We are certain to find, a big, broad mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a heart that is soft and warm.<br />
And he carries his woes in a lordly way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As only the great souls can:<br />
And it makes us glad when in truth we say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are kin of the Englishman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>He slams his door in the face of the world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If he thinks the world too bold.<br />
He will even curse; but he opens his purse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the poor, and the sick, and the old.<br />
He is slow in giving to woman the vote,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And slow to put up her fan;<br />
But he gives her room in the hour of doom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dies&mdash;like an Englishman.</p>

Her weightiest hour of kingly power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To offer England&rsquo;s son.<br />
The rising bell of Progress rings;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Truths which long have slept,<br />
Like prophets strange, predicting change,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Time&rsquo;s chariot run.</p>
<p class="poetry">The greatest Empire of the Earth.<br />

Like arteries her Colonies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reach out from sea to sea.<br />
She clasps all races in her girth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze the world commands;<br />
And far and wide where strong ships ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The British Flag floats free.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Their round of Cosmic law,<br />
And souls evolved in ways unsolved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kingdoms reached their prime<br />
Has Destiny held out to Man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A gift so full of awe,<br />
As England&rsquo;s crown which she hands down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this stupendous time.</p>
<p class="poetry">This is a crucial hour, when Fate<br />

To feel more love, and build thereof<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An everlasting Throne.</p>
<p class="poetry">The dreaming East, awake at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is asking &lsquo;when&rsquo; and
&lsquo;why&rsquo;;<br />
Wait not too long nor answer wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor in too stern a voice.<br />
Let England profit by her past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with her wise reply<br />
Rouse hearts, within her foster kin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hope, and to rejoice.</p>

9</span>True wealth dwells not in things we own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in our <i>use</i> of things.<br />
Who would command a conquered land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must conquer first its heart.<br />
Such might as Man has never known,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And power undreamed by kings,<br />
And boundless strength would come at length<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To one who used that art.</p>
<p class="poetry">For now has dawned the People&rsquo;s day:<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; A day of great unrest.<br />
Nor king nor creed can still man&rsquo;s need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of time and space to grow.<br />
All lands must shape a wider way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For this eternal quest;<br />
And Leisure yield a larger field<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where work-worn feet may go.</p>

<p class="poetry">They walked the valley of the dead;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lit by a weird half light;<br />
No sound they made, no word they said;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they were pale with fright.<br />
Then suddenly from unseen places came<br />
Loud laughter, that was like a whip of flame.</p>
<p class="poetry">They looked, and saw, beyond, above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A land where wronged souls wait;<br />
(Those spirits called to earth by love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And driven back by hate).<br />
And each one stood in anguish dumb and wild,<br />
As she beheld the phantom of her child.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, saw the soul her wish had hurled<br />

Before it reached the Mother world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or drew its natal breath.<br />

Yet are we lonely, now they are not here.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus spake the spectral children; thus<br />

OF LOVE AND THE SEA</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">When first we met (the Sea and I),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one before a King,<br />
I stood in awe; nor felt nor saw<br />
The sun, the winds, the earth, the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or any other thing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s Universe, to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was just the
Sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">When next we met, the lordly Main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Played but a courtier&rsquo;s part;<br />
Crowned Queen was I; and earth and sky,<br />
And sun and sea were my domain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since love was in my heart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before, beyond, above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was only
Love.</p>
<h3><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">Love built me, on a little rock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little house of pine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, the Sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat angrily<br />
About that house of mine;<br />
(That dear, dear home of mine).</p>
<p class="poetry">But when it turned to go away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the sandy track,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down o&rsquo;er its wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house would call,<br />
Until the Sea came back;<br />
(It always hurried back).</p>
<p class="poetry">And now the two have grown so fond,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oh, breathe no word of this),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When clouds hang low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And east winds blow,<br />
They meet and kiss and kiss:<br />
(At night, I hear them kiss).</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">No man can understand the Sea, until<br />
He knows all passions of the senses; all<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>The great
emotions of the heart; and each<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exalted aspiration of the soul.<br />
Then may he sit beside the sea and say:<br />
&lsquo;I, too, have flung myself against the rocks,<br />
And kissed their flinty brows with no return;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fallen spent upon unfeeling sands.<br />
I, too, have gone forth yearning, to far shores,<br />
Seeking that something which would bring content;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And finding only what I took away;<br />
And I have looked up, through the veil of skies,<br />
When all the world was still, and understood<br />
That I am one with Nature and with God.&rsquo;</p>

Not those who have been cradled in its heart,<br />

Or realise its grandeur.&nbsp; Oft we meet<br />
Some stranger who has stayed his passing feet<br />
And lingered with us for a single hour,<br />
And learned more of cathedral, and of tower,<br />
Than we, who deem our knowledge quite complete.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not always those we hold most loved and
dear,<br />
Not always those who dwell with us, know best<br />
Our greater selves.&nbsp; Because they stand so near<br />
They cannot see the lofty mountain crest,<br />
The gleaming sun-kissed height, which fair and dear<br />
Stands forth&mdash;revealed unto the some-time guest.</p>

Through old traditions.&nbsp; Leave your dead to sleep<br />

And beat the air, as madmen beat a wall,<br />
Till, impotent, and broken with despair,<br />

Then, bringing to me gifts of recompense,<br />
Came keener hearing, finer taste, and touch;<br />

Then silence came, and unavailing tears.<br />
The stillness stabbed me, like a two edged-knife;<br />

Such harmonies, such congruous sweet chords,<br />
Wherein each note conveys a healing balm.<br />

One waits outside the casement edge;<br />
One paces to and fro.</p>

Far out the mad Sea went;<br />
Beyond the raft, like one gone daft;<br />

Smiled down the Bungalow.</p>

<p class="poetry">I seemed to dwell in this same world, and in
this modern time;<br />
Yet nowhere was there sight or sound of poverty or crime.<br />
All strife had ceased; men were disarmed; and quiet Peace had
made<br />
A thousand avenues for toil, in place of War&rsquo;s grim
trade.<br />
From east to west, from north to south where highways smooth and
broad<br />
Tied State to State, the waste lands bloomed, like garden spots
of God.<br />
There were no beggars in the streets; there were no
unemployed,<br />
For each man owned his plot of ground, and laboured and
enjoyed.<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Sweet

And when I marvelled at the sight, thus spake a Voice to me:<br

&lsquo;All Motherhood is now an art; the greatest art on
earth;<br />
And nowhere is there known the crime of one unwelcome birth<br />
From rights of parentage the sick and sinful are debarred;<br />
For Matron Science keeps our house, and at the door stands
guard.<br />
We know the cure for darkness lies in letting in the light;<br />
And Prisons are replaced by Schools, where wrong views change to
right.<br />
The wisdom, knowledge, study, thought, once bent on beast and
sod,<br />
We give now to the human race, the highest work of God;<br />
And, as the gardener chooses seed, so we select with care;<br />
And as our Man Plant grows, we give him soil and sun and air.<br

Born of some vast world accident,<br />

73</span>&lsquo;THE TAVERN OF LAST TIMES&rsquo;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">(AT BOX HILL, SURREY)</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">A modern hour from London (as we spin<br />
Into a silver thread the miles of space<br />
Between us and our goal), there is a place<br />
Apart from city traffic, dust, and din,<br />
Green with great trees, where hides a quiet Inn.<br />
Here Nelson last looked on the lovely face<br />
Which made his world; and by its magic grace<br />
Trailed rosy clouds across each early sin.<br />
And, leaning lawnward, is the room where Keats<br />
Wrote the last one of those immortal songs<br />
(Called by the critics of his day &lsquo;mere rhymes&rsquo;).<br
/>
A lark, high in the boxwood bough repeats<br />
Those lyric strains, to idle passing throngs,<br />
There by the little Tavern-of-Last-Times.</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>THE
TWO AGES</h2>
<p class="poetry">On a great cathedral window I have seen<br />
A Summer sunset swoon and sink away,<br />
Lost in the splendours of immortal art.<br />
Angels and saints and all the heavenly hosts,<br />
With smiles undimmed by half a thousand years,<br />
From wall and niche have met my lifted gale.<br />
Sculpture and carving and illumined page,<br />
And the fair, lofty dreams of architects,<br />
That speak of beauty to the centuries&mdash;<br />
All these have fed me with divine repasts.<br />
Yet in my mouth is left a bitter taste,<br />
The taste of blood that stained that age of art.</p>
<p class="poetry">Those glorious windows shine upon the black<br
/>
And hideous structure of the guillotine;<br />
Beside the haloed countenance of saints<br />
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>There
hangs the multiple and knotted lash.<br />
The Christ of love, benign and beautiful,<br />
Looks at the torture-rack, by hate conceived<br />
And bigotry sustained.&nbsp; The prison cell,<br />
With blood-stained walls, where starving men went mad,<br />
Lies under turrets matchless in their grace.</p>
<p class="poetry">God, what an age!&nbsp; How was it that You
let<br />
Colossal genius and colossal crime<br />
Walk for a hundred years across the earth,<br />
Like giant twins?&nbsp; How was it then that men,<br />
Conceiving such vast beauty for the world,<br />
And such large hopes of heaven, could entertain<br />
Such hellish projects for their human kin?<br />
How could the hand that, with consummate skill<br />
And loving patience, limned the luminous page,<br />
Drop pen and brush, and seize the branding-rod,<br />
To scourge a brother for his differing faith?</p>
<p class="poetry">Not great this age in beauty or in art;<br />
Nothing is wrought to-day that shall endure<br />
For earth&rsquo;s adornment, through long centuries;<br />
Not ours the fervid worship of a God<br />
That wastes its splendid opulence on glass,<br />
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Leaving
but hate for hungry human hearts.<br />
Yet great this age; its mighty work is man<br />
Knowing himself the universal life.<br />
And great our faith, which shows itself in works<br />
For human freedom and for racial good.<br />
The true religion lies in being kind.<br />
No age is greater than its faith is broad.<br />
Through liberty and love men climb to God.</p>

With onward pointing feet and searching eyes<br />
Would God have set me squarely on the track<br />
Up which we all must labour with life&rsquo;s pack?<br />
Yonder the goal of all this travel lies.<br />
What matters it, if yesterday the skies<br />
With light were golden, or with clouds were black?<br />
I would not lose to-morrow&rsquo;s glow of dawn<br />
By peering backward after sun&rsquo;s long set.<br />
New hope is fairer than an old regret;<br />
Let me pursue my journey and press on&mdash;<br />
Nor tearful eyed, stand ever in one spot,<br />
A briny statue like the wife of Lot.</p>

<p class="poetry">We cannot choose our sorrows.&nbsp; One there
was<br />
Who, reverent of soul, and strong with trust,<br />
Cried, &lsquo;God, though Thou shouldst bow me to the dust,<br />
Yet will I praise thy everlasting laws.<br />
Beggared, my faith would never halt or pause,<br />
But sing Thy glory, feasting on a crust.<br />
Only one boon, one precious boon I must<br />
Demand of Thee, O opulent great Cause.<br />
Let Love stay with me, constant to the end,<br />
Though fame pass by and poverty pursue.&rsquo;<br />

And God is nowhere.&nbsp; Would God so deride<br />
A loving creature&rsquo;s faith?&rsquo;&nbsp; A voice replied,<br

&lsquo;The stream flows onward to the Source Supreme,<br />
Where things that ARE replace the things that SEEM,<br />
And where the deeds of all past lives abide.<br />
Once at thy door Love languished and was spurned.<br />
Who sorrow plants, must garner sorrow&rsquo;s sheaf.<br />
No prayers can change the seedling in the sod.<br />
By thine own heart Love&rsquo;s anguish must be learned.<br />
Pass on, and know, as one made wise by grief,<br />

GOSSIPS</h2>
<p class="poetry">A rose in my garden, the sweetest and
fairest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was hanging her head through the long golden
hours;<br />
And early one morning I saw her tears falling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heard a low gossiping talk in the bowers.</p>
<p class="poetry">The yellow Nasturtium, a spinster all faded,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Was telling a Lily what ailed the poor Rose:<br />
&lsquo;That wild, roving Bee, who was hanging about her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has jilted her squarely, as every one knows.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I knew when he came, with his singing

&nbsp;&nbsp; His airs and his speeches, so fine and so sweet,<br

Just how it would end; but no one would believe me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all were quite ready to fall at his
feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&lsquo;Indeed, you are wrong,&rsquo; said the Lilybelle
proudly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I cared nothing for him.&nbsp; He called on
me once<br />
And would have come often, no doubt, if I&rsquo;d asked him.<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; But though he was handsome, I thought him a

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Now, now, that&rsquo;s not true,&rsquo;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;He has travelled and seen every flower that
grows;<br />
And one who has supped in the garden of princes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We all might have known would not wed with the
Rose.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But wasn&rsquo;t she proud when he
showed her attention?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she let him caress her,&rsquo; said sly
Mignonette.<br />
&lsquo;And I used to see it and blush for her folly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The silly thing thinks he will come to her
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I thought he was splendid,&rsquo; said
pretty, pert Larkspur.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;So dark and so grand, with that gay cloak of

bold.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&lsquo;Oh, fie!&rsquo; laughed the Almond.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That does for a story.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I hang down my head, yet I see all that
goes;<br />
And I saw you reach out, trying hard to detain him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But he just tapped your cheek and flew by to the
Rose.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;He cared nothing for her, he only was
flirting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To while away time, as every one knew;<br />
So I turned a cold shoulder to all his advances,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I was certain his heart was
untrue.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The Rose it served right for her folly
in trusting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An oily-tongued stranger,&rsquo; quoth proud
Columbine.<br />
&lsquo;I knew what he was, and thought once I would warn her.<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; But, of course, the affair was no business of
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; cried the Peony,
shrugging her shoulders,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw all along that the Bee was a flirt;<br

But the Rose has been always so praised and so petted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought a good lesson would do her no

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the whole garden listened to hear what was
said.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the dark, handsome Bee, with his cloak
o&rsquo;er his shoulder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came swift through the sunlight and kissed the sad
Rose,<br />
And whispered: &lsquo;My darling, I&rsquo;ve roved the world

A hope long surrendered and covered with dust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pastime, out-grown, and forgot,<br />

Though in Memory&rsquo;s House I still wander full oft,<br />

chiming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And back in the woodland a little bird sang;<br />
And, doubt it who will, yet those two sounds were rhyming,<br />

<p class="poetry"><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>So back he rode the very next day<br />
All in his coach and four,<br />
And he went each day whether dry or wet,<br />
Until he married the sweet Annette<br />
(In spite of her lack of lore).<br />
But they didn&rsquo;t trudge off on foot together,<br />
For he bought her a hat with a long, long feather,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they rode in the coach and four.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now a thing like this could happen we know,<br
/>
All in a coach and four;<br />
But the fact of it is, &rsquo;twixt me and you,<br />
There isn&rsquo;t a word of the story true<br />
(Pardon I do implore).<br />
It is only a foolish and fanciful song<br />
That came to me as I rode along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All in a coach and four.</p>

105</span>SONGS OF A COUNTRY HOME</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">Who has not felt his heart leap up, and glow<br
/>
What time the Tulips first begin to blow,<br />
Has one sweet joy still left for him to know.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is like early love&rsquo;s imagining,<br />
That fragile pleasure which the Tulips bring,<br />
When suddenly we see them, in the Spring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not all the garden&rsquo;s later royal
train,<br />
Not great triumphant Roses, when they reign,<br />
Can bring that delicate delight again.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">One of the sweetest hours is this;<br />
(Of all I think we like it best);<br />
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>A little
restful oasis,<br />
Between the breakfast and the post.<br />
Just south of coffee and of toast,<br />
Just north of daily task and duty;<br />
Just west of dreams, this island gleams,<br />
A fertile spot of peace and beauty.</p>
<p class="poetry">We wander out across the lawn;<br />
We idle by a bush in bloom;<br />
The household pets come following on;<br />
Or if the day is one of gloom,<br />
We loiter in a pleasant room,<br />
Or from a casement lean and chatter.<br />
Then comes the mail, like sudden hail,<br />
And off we scatter.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">When Roses die, in languid August days,<br />
We leave the garden to its fallen ways,<br />
And seek the shelter of wide porticoes,<br />
Where Honeysuckle in defiance blows<br />
Undaunted by the sun&rsquo;s too ardent rays.</p>
<p class="poetry">The matron Summer turns a wistful gaze<br />
Across green valleys, back to tender Mays;<br />
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>And
something of her large contentment goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roses die;<br />
Yet all her subtle fascination stays<br />
To lure us into idle, sweet delays.<br />
The lowered awning by the hammock shows<br />
Inviting nooks for dreaming and repose;<br />
Oh, restful are the pleasures of those days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roses die.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p class="poetry">The summer folk, fled back to town;<br />
The green woods changed to red and brown;<br />
A sound upon the frosty air<br />
Of windows closing everywhere.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then the log, lapped by a blaze&mdash;<br
/>
Oh! what is better than these days;<br />
With books and friends and love a-near;<br />
Go on, gay world, but leave me here.</p>
<h2><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>WORTHY THE NAME OF &lsquo;SIR KNIGHT&rsquo;</h2>
<p class="poetry">Sir Knight of the world&rsquo;s oldest
order,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Knight of the Army of God,<br />
You have crossed the strange mystical border,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground-floor of truth you have trod;<br />
You stand on the typical threshold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which leads to the temple above;<br />
Where you come as a stone, and a Christ-chosen one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Kingdom of Friendship and Love.</p>
<p class="poetry">As you stand in this new realm of beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where each man you meet is your friend,<br />
Think not that your promise of duty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hall, or asylum, shall end.<br />
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Outside,
in the great world of pleasure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond in the clamour of trade,<br />
In the battle of life and its coarse daily strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember the vows you have made.</p>
<p class="poetry">Your service, majestic and solemn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your symbols, suggestive and sweet,<br />
Your uniform phalanx in column<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On gala-days marching the street;<br />
Your sword and your plume and your helmet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your &lsquo;secrets&rsquo; hid from the
world&rsquo;s sight;<br />
These things are the small, lesser parts of the all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which are needed to form the true Knight.</p>
<p class="poetry">The martyrs who perished rejoicing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Templary&rsquo;s glorious laws,<br />
Who died &rsquo;midst the faggots while voicing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory and worth of their cause&mdash;<br />
They honoured the title of &lsquo;Templar&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more than the Knight of to-day,<br />
Who mars not the name with one blemish of shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But carries it clean through life&rsquo;s fray.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>To live for a cause; to endeavour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make your deeds grace it; to try<br />
And uphold its precepts for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is harder by far than to die.<br />
For the battle of life is unending,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy, Self, never tires,<br />
And the true Knight must slay that sly foe every day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere he reaches the heights he desires.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sir Knight, have you pondered the meaning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all you have heard and been told?<br />
Have you strengthened your heart for its weaning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From vices and faults loved of old?<br />
Will you honour, in hours of temptation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your promises noble and grand?<br />
Will your spirit be strong to do battle with wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;And, having done all, to stand&rsquo;?</p>
<p class="poetry">Will you ever be true to a brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In actions as well as in creed?<br />
Will you stand by his side as no other<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could stand, in the hour of his need?<br />
Will you boldly defend him from peril,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lift from him poverty&rsquo;s curse&mdash;<br />
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Will the
promise of old, which you willingly made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reach down from your lips to your purse?</p>
<p class="poetry">The world&rsquo;s battle-field is before
you:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Wisdom walk close by your side,<br />
Let Faith spread her snowy wings o&rsquo;er you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Truth be your comrade and guide;<br />
Let Fortitude, Justice, and Mercy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct all your conduct aright,<br />
And let each word and act tell to men the proud fact,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are worthy the name of &lsquo;Sir
Knight.&rsquo;</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
